This tool was built for detecting the physical phenomena of laminar to turbulent transition (LTT) of the flow on a wind turbine blade or on aircraft wing sections from Infrared Thermography camera images. The tool consist of 4 codes for 4 steps:
	1. Image manipulation for camera angle correctiona dn lens distortion correction
	2. Image calibration for different angle of attack values (the translation between chordwise physical positions to pixels on the image for each angle of attack)
	3. LTT detection for positive angle of attack values
LTT detection for negative angle of attack values![image](https://github.com/ozsioz/InfraDet-LTT/assets/151535937/ac7a23eb-0693-485b-b662-e1dd0beb4532)
